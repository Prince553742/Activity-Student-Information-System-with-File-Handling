Very hard most of the times I ask chatgpt for some help cause I think the storing part is a little tricky where all the value with different 
storing type is inside one storing type which is the dictionary its like a nested dictionary but through it all I manage to understand the logic
although I am still new to python, I am trying my very best to stay alive lol <3
